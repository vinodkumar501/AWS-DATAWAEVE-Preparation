IAM 
->user
->group
->Policies
->roles

The Security Token Service allows for temporary credentials to be used with identity federation, delegation, cross-account access, and IAM roles.

Grant least privileges is an IAM Best Practices that makes sure users only have access to what they need and nothing more

You can delegate permissions using roles. Itâ€™s a great way to provide permissions to resources for users and services without using permanent credentials.


============================================== Scenario: If your vm need to connect with other like s3 need to perform ============================================


1. ec2 instance
2.create iam role "readonlys3" access
3.create a bucket 
4. add role to ec2 instance

then execute while login to the vm 


#aws s3 ls
dataweave213


#aws s3 ls s3://dataweave213

============================

you can also access using secret and access keys but it wilil store the keys in the vm console of ./aws but its not recommended approach. once you added keys you can execute 
any step of aws cli


#aws s3 ls

using roles is secure way compared to secret keys . both will perform same action but using secret key( store in vm ./aws folder ) its not good approach.
